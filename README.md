# audiometry-app-python
my stupid free time project that was 85% vibe coded but kind of works 

# why did i make this?
because i could and i was inspired to do so by my friend making a qt thing that draws sparkles on your screen

# what does it do?
it ear test. thats it. thats... thats what it does. yes, yes, totally a lot of things.
it has database capabilities. it will save stuff you enter to the database.
and it looks glossy, chrome, gradienty, aero.

# what is the future of it?
probably dead. but why would it need to be? we can make it good. we can make it better. 
we can add features like theming. modularity. we can add printer support.
but why?

because its cool.

the buttons are chrome styled. the text boxes have gradients. the list has a gradient too.
